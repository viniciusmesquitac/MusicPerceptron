My name is Vinicius and i am computer science student.
 
As a music enthusiast and lover, I think that is incredible what people can do using music, like as in programming, you can improve through practice and hard work. 🎹🎶👨🏽‍💻
 
In this playgroundbook I will show how it is possible to acquire musical perception using programming as your ally.
 
 ## But what is musical perception?
 
 Musical perception is the ability to assign characteristics to sound stimuli and transform it
 
 on musical notes so that it can be played.
 
 For me it is a new experience of listening to the world.
 
 
 ## What are we going to do? 🤔
 
 We will use technology to our advantage! creating and training an AI model that can
 
 identify and help us in our own learning process! seems interesting?
 
 
 ## How to do this? 🤯
 
For that, we will need to follow some steps to build a prediction model

First we will collect data, then train it and finally test it, it seems easy, right?
 
Enough talk, shall we start?
